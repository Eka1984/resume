    <h2>Career Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a dedicated fourth-year student at Lapland University of Applied
      Sciences, pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in IT with
      a focus on software development. Transitioning from a successful 13-year
      career at Lamex Foods Inc. as a logistics and documentation specialist in

      development, coupled with strong teamwork, problem-solving, and
      communication skills, I am seeking an internship or entry-level position
      in software development to further deepen my skills and apply my knowledge
      in a real-world setting.
